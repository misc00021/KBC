- ## kbc
    ### Usage
    - target/debug/kbc <input_file> --num_rules=<num_rules> to complete until <num_rules> is reached
    - target/debug/kbc <input_file> --max_term_size=<max_size> to complete until the next rule's LHS has len > max_size
    - target/debug/kbc <input_file> --add_guards to add constraints, preventing division by zero
    ### Contains hardcoded flags for...
    - handling rules, unorderable using KBO
    - extending/replacing rules during completion
- ## kbc-test
    - Contains code for testing with EqSat using egg
    - Contains Python scripts for comparing and summarizing results
- ## term_gen
    - Randomly generates test terms
- ## greedy
    - Implements greedy rewriting
    - Contains Python script to compare results of two rulesets/methods
    - Contains Python script to run on a specific directory and summarize the results as csv

# Notes for replication of results
- Rule set size numbers reflect number of rules generated by KBC, i.e.
    - Twee generates x many rules and deletes y many useless rules in the process => declared set size: x, actual size: x - y
- Due to condition encoding, Twee may generate nonsensical rules, e.g.: 0 -> 1 if is_not_zero(0), 0 -> 0/x if is_not_zero(x)
    - egg will complain, rules need to be deleted manually
        - Maybe works automatically now
- egg math has no negation operator, -1 is a constant
    - Using -1 as a constant messes with Twees ordering => program kbc changes -1 to (neg 1) before completion and back after
- Twee cannot order all critical pairs, ordering happens in program kbc, i.e.
    - s = t => t -> s if vars in t > vars in s s -> t otherwise
