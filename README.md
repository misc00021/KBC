- ### kbc
    - Translates between rule encodings
    - Calls Twee for extending rules
- ### kbc-test
    - Contains code for testing with EqSat using egg
- ### term_gen
    - Randomly generates test terms

## Notes for replication of results
- Rule set size numbers reflect number of rules generated by KBC, i.e.
    - Twee generates x many rules and deletes y many useless rules in the process => declared set size: x, actual size: x - y
- Due to condition encoding, Twee may generate nonsensical rules, e.g.: 0 -> 1 if is_not_zero(0), 0 -> 0/x if is_not_zero(x)
    - egg will complain, rules need to be deleted manually
        - Maybe works automatically now
- egg math has no negation operator, -1 is a constant
    - Using -1 as a constant messes with Twees ordering => program kbc changes -1 to (neg 1), currently the inverse is done manually
- Twee cannot order all critical pairs, ordering happens in program kbc, i.e.
    - s = t => t -> s if vars in t > vars in s s -> t otherwise
